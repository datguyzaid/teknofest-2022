# Mission
A swarm of drones carries out a search and rescue operation on a sufficiently large area while delivering unique payloads to designated ground markers efficiently.
<br> The implemenation of the system makes it so that it is:
* Completely Autonomous
* Scalable to any number of drones
* Decentralized meaning there is no single point of failure
* Invariant to the shape or size of the search area

Drones use a mesh networking protocol Digi Mesh for communicating with each other.
